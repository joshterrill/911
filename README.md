# 911
a silly psuedo-911-dispatch app

### what it will do
Let you either be a dispatcher who sends police, fire, or medical to a certain address. Watch them navigate to the address in real time.

Or

Let you be someone who is dispatched, play a fire fighter, police, or medic and be dispatched to a location. Get real time updates on where to go and conditions n the road.

### what it does now
Gets your current location, shows you on the map as a medic, police, or fire fighter, and shows you directions to a destination. As you navigate, the map updates in real time.

Change the END LOCATION and press enter for the map to update and give you new directions and route.

### install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshterrill/911
cd 911/
npm install
npm start
```
